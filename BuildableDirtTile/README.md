# BuildableDirtTile

Allows building a natural dirt block.

# Features
* Dirt Blocks for Pip farming.

# How To Use
1. Research Basic Farming
2. Build the tile like a normal tile.

# Current Limitations
* There is a net loss of 50% of the mass of the block if you dig them back up. (I personally feel this is part of balancing it, even if it's default ONI behavior)
