# FavoritesCategory

Create a Favorites Category for the Resource Listing on right side of screen.

# Features
* Stays through Save/Load

# How To Use
1. Mouse-Over the Resource, AKA `Element`, in the Resource Listing on the right side of the Screen, AKA `The Inventory`.
2. Hold Shift and Click the Left Mouse Button to `Toggle` the `Element` to show up under Favorites.
